# Pathfinding-AI-Simulator

A simple path finding robot with the simulator of it in a grid base environment. 

The robot has 2 infrared sensor which is used to detect if there's object in front of it, one has a wider range and one has a smaller range. The objective for the robot is to get to the object without running out of battery. 

## #TODO

Further improvement needed on the robot's algorithm. The robot should try to get to its chaeger when battery is low; and the moving steps should be improved. 
(Could be done by adding more tuples in the knowledge nodes)
